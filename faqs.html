          Difference Between Traditional DISPUTING And M2CA’s Tactic Of CHECKING
          FOR CERTIFIED COMPLIANCE OF REPORTING And CHALLENGING Missing Or
          Deficient Aspects Of Reporting(S)?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In short, to DISPUTE is literally an ARGUMENT AGAINST the TRUTH and
          VALIDITY OF A CLAIM IN ITS REALITY
          <br />
          Where as:
          <br />
          M2CA does NOT concern itself with a claim’s REALITY but only it’s
          REPORTING(s) and PROCESSES of reporting. We do NOT argue that an item
          is or is not true or correct or valid or anything of the sort, we
          instead simply REQUEST if the WAY REPORTED and the PROCESS OF
          REPORTING was and IS COMPLIANT to state and federal standards and
          laws. And if there is any insufficiencies or inabilities or
          unwillingness’s to demonstrate the factual certified compliant
          reporting REGARDLESS OF TRUTH ANND VALIDITY of claim(s) we leverage
          the Metro 2 Five Points of Compliance as well as the MANDATORILY
          PERFECT and COMPLETE certification of the METRO 2 FORMAT REPORTING.
          Even TRUE, VALID claims can be FAULTY in its PROCESS OF REPORTING and
          as such is DERELICT IN ITS REPORTING. In that tone, just because a
          debt in reality fails to be report-able does NOT equate to it as
          wellbeing uncollect-able. Fact is, the requisites for REPORTING an
          injurious claim versus a consumer is far much stricter than that of
          simply collecting. Literally, to lawfully collect a claim debt on
          needs be TRUE and VALID (NOT NECESSARILY VERIFIABLE ßthat is a
          REPORTING criterion), where as to lawfully report there MUST BE
          undoubted evidence of document CERTIFIABLE COMPLIANCE of reporting for
          claims factually TRUE, CORRECT, COMPLETE, PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE ,
          VALID and PERFECT in its mandatory METRO 2 FORMAT REPORTING(s). Any
          claim DEFICIENT of requisites is lawfully UNFIT to report! THAT IS OUR
          ANGLE and the KEY NOTE difference between DISPUTING (reality) and M2C
          Method CHECKS & CHALLENGES (reporting-based) .
        </p>
        <h3>How Is The M2C METHOD “Different” Than Competition?</h3>
        <p>
          That is easy, simply read answer to #1 above, lol. Seriously, the
          PRIMARY DIFFERENCE is that in order to argue the COMPLIANCE-aspects
          the claim had to FIRST SURVIVE the requisites of VALIDITY AND TRUTH OF
          CLAIM (the DISPUTING necessities). Point is, the M2C Method of
          Compliance-based CHECKS and CHALLENGES goes FURTHER than a DISPUTE of
          ANY SHORT WOULD because the fact is an item that fails measures of
          disputing would never survive a M2CA standard, but an item not
          necessarily COMPLIANTLY REPORTED can in fact be both TRUE and VALID
          and if so it SURVIVES traditional DISPUTING methodologies! That is to
          say that NATURALLY the M2C Method CHECKS & CHALLENGES already have a
          BUILT-IN ‘DISPUTING’ matrix it survived!
        </p>
        <h3>Difference Between FICO And FAKO?</h3>
        <p>
          Literally ANYTHING OTHER THAN A FICO is a FAKO score, regardless where
          it is derived! Essentially NON-FICO scores are just EDUCATIONAL in
          nature and purpose whereas typically lenders use one of the many FICO
          scores.
        </p>

        <h3>What Is VANTAGESCORE 3?</h3>
        <p>
          For one it is a FAKO simply because it is NOT a FICO score. VS3 is a
          scoring model adopted/created by the actual credit mafia themselves
          (the main three CRAs that is). In general MOST available scoring
          models out there on credit monitoring sites such as credit karma and
          others use or use a form of VS3, thereby actually making the VS3 the
          most widely utilized credit report scoring model in use, SHOCKING,
          huh?
